# CI/CD Demo Project

This is a simple demonstration of CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

The project includes:
- A basic counter web application
- Automated tests
- Continuous deployment to GitHub Pages

## How it works

1. When you push changes to the main branch, GitHub Actions automatically runs tests
2. If tests pass, your site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages
3. Visit https://R-hab.github.io/CI-CD/ to see the live site
